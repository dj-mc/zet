I will provide references to other resources as I learn them.

- bebop style vocabulary
- harmonic variations, function analysis/chart
- tri-tone substitutions
- melodic minor mode substitutions
- cycle of dominant substitutions
- 3rds and flat-9ths on dominant chords
- chromatically descending minor seventh chords
- augmented major seven and minor major seven chords (implying melodic minor)
- guide tones, approach notes, and target notes
- the big three progressions
- use diminished scaled for both diminished and dominant sounds
- blues, diminished, dim-dom, altered diminished, lydian dominant

## tone

---

- your tone is just as important as your technique
- your tone will sound different in your bedroom vs. a live gig
- your mid-frequencies may need a boost while playing live
- pop songs' guitars are often mastered with "scooped" frequencies
- valve amp vs. solid-state Randall stacks

## ear training

---

- understand what you hear
- replicate it on your instrument
- work out solos the hard way
- jam in real time (improvise)
- practice transcribing

## transcribing

---

- build a lick library
- keep a permanent record of everything you learn
- go for individual licks, not entire tracks
- get the context (which ideas using which chords)
- start with the overall structure of a piece
- map out chord progressions as beats and bars
- pick out prominent notes then fill in the gaps
- slow things down (or use a phrase sampler)
- use a MiniDisc player to mark interesting times

## record yourself

---

- monitor long-term progress
- make an honest, objective appraisal of strong and weak points
- make a backing track to practice new progressions or scales
- a smartphone or mono-tape recorder is good enough
- or use a Lexicon JamMan, Boss Loop Station, or a Boomerang
- or use a Line6 Delay Modeler or other delay effects
- (humble) Fender Supro amp while studio recording
- fancy gear is not *really* necessary for most purposes

## build a piece of music

---

- write a full tune, not 20 unrelated progressions
- observe how a piece of music's structure is put together
- hint: repetition, repetition, repetition, surprise

## sight-reading

## fair warnings

---

- don't shun forms of music through prejudice
- learn from everything you hear; avoid tunnel vision
- *reliance* on transcriptions fosters *laziness*
- don't worship your guitar heroes (for too long)
- figure out what's good about a guitarist's technique then **move on**

## health

- your instruments are vulnerable to temperature/humidity change
- warm up your hands and stretch your wrists/forearms before playing
- practice good posture while playing to avoid injury
- playing your instrument should feel effortless and natural
- ensure your spine and wrists are as straight as possible
- you probably play with too much tension in your hands
